## About the Project

HerbVerse is a cross-platform wellness marketplace aimed at bridging the gap between health-conscious consumers and holistic wellness vendors. The platform allows customers to discover and purchase herbal teas, supplements, and book consultations with natural health experts, while providing vendors with an easy-to-use space to list products, manage orders, and interact with their audience.

### Inspiration
The inspiration for HerbVerse stems from the growing global interest in natural wellness and holistic health. We saw a gap in the market where herbal product sellers and wellness practitioners lacked a unified, user-friendly digital platform. HerbVerse is designed to solve that problem by connecting these two groups in a seamless, easy-to-navigate environment.

## Features
- **Customers** can:
  - Discover herbal teas, supplements, and wellness products
  - Book consultations with holistic health experts
  - Securely check out and track deliveries
  
- **Vendors** can:
  - Create profiles and manage products
  - View and manage inventory and orders
  - Interact with customers without needing technical skills

## Tech Stack
- typescript

### Future Goals
- Integrating real payment gateways like Stripe or M-Pesa
- Expanding vendor features (analytics, discounts, and shipping management)
- Launching a mobile app using React Native
- Partnering with local herbal communities to onboard real vendors
- Enabling AI-driven product recommendations based on customer health preferences

## Features & Screenshots
- **Clean UI for both Mobile and Web**: Fully responsive design with accessibility in mind
- **Role-based Views**: Vendors and customers experience a tailored interface
- **Product Recommendations**: Dynamic suggestions and bundles (e.g., Sleep Bundle)

## Challenges Faced
- Managing separate workflows for vendors and customers in a single UI
- Ensuring secure role-based access (vendors cannot view customer profiles and vice versa)
- Optimizing image uploads from mobile devices
- Building the prototype without a live payment gateway

## Accomplishments We're Proud Of
- A functional prototype that demonstrates key use cases for customers and vendors
- A fully responsive UI with minimal learning curve
- Conditional rendering and secure routing in the React + Flask stack
- Integration of product recommendation logic and bundles
